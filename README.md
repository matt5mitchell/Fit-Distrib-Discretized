Functions to fit a continuous distribution to discretized data

In many industries, it is common to encounter continuous data that has been discretized into categorical "chunks." For example, age may be stored in a database as "age range" rather than as an integer.  While discretized data has its uses, there are times when it would be helpful to  have the original continuous data. Short of a time machine, the best we can do is estimate the distribution that the original data came from, and then we can use this distribution for further analysis. This repository contains functions and a brief example for fitting a continuous distribution to discretized data.
